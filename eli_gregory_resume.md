Well over a decade of iOS development, I've built a wide variety of tasteful apps for companies at all sizes, with a keen product sense, natural design instincts, and deep engineering curiosity. I'm comfortable making sustainable, best-practice decisions, iterating quickly and prioritizing the needs of the business. I obsess on the details and won't ship unless I'm confident in the product. My sweet spot is building apps from 0 to 1.
